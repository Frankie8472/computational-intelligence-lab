# Collaborative Filtering
## Project Option 1

A recommender system is concerned with presenting items (e.g. books on Amazon, movies at Movielens or music at lastFM) that are likely to interest the user. In collaborative filtering, we base our recommendations on the (known) preference of the user towards other items, and also take into account the preferences of other users.
