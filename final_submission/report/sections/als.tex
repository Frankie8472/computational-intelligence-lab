\subsubsection{\ac{ALS}}

\ac{ALS} is an optimization technique for factor matrices $U$ and $V$. In every iteration alternately either $U$ or $V$ is fixed and the other is being adjusted. The matrices are updated using the following equations, where $\lambda$ is a regularization factor:
\begin{equation}
    U = (VV^T + \lambda I)^{-1}VA^T
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    V = (UU^T + \lambda I)^{-1}UA
\end{equation}
In each iteration the error can either decrease or remain unchanged and thus, it guarantees convergence to a local minimum and a minimal \ac{RMSE}.
