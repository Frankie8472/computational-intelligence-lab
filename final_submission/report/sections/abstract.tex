  In this paper we present a novel approach to the collaborative filtering problem. We have explored various popular baseline models and developed a new approach based on the \ac{EDP} algorithm. We consider different optimization techniques using \ac{SGD}, Adam, and the One-Cycle Policy and combine the results with bootstrap aggregation. The results show that we can reduce the RMSE significantly, not only compared to our baseline algorithms, but also compared to the used models each on its own. We discuss and analyze our results and consider future improvements to our approach.
