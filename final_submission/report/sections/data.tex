\section{Data}
We obtained our data set from the ETH Zurich Computational Intelligence Lab 2020 Collaborative Filtering Kaggle project page\footnote{https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/cil-collab-filtering-2020}. It contains 1'176'952 integer ratings in the interval [1, 5]. Each entry represents a user rating an item and is identified by user and movie ID. There are a total of 10'000 users and 1'000 items. The given data set only contains 11.8\% of all ratings. We denote these ratings given by the data set as \textit{known ratings}.

Looking at the data, we have observed that the majority of users have rated less than 20\% of all items and that the majority of items were rated by less than 17\% of users. Furthermore, we have seen that the given ratings are not uniformly distributed. 88.9\% of known ratings are in the interval [3, 5] with 5 being the rating with the highest occurrence.
