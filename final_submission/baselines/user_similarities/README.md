# KNN Baseline algorithm

This is our implementation of the KNN algorithm used for our baseline. The implementation is partly based on an article
found online at [https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-simple-recommender-systems-in-python-647e5bcd78bd]

## How to run

```bash
python3 similarity.py
```

The output will be saved into the folder `output` as `KNNSubmission.csv`. Every run overwrites the previous file.
